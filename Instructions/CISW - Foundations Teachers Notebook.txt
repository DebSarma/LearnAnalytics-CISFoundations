Module Script:

Slide 1: Title Slide
1. Display slide and welcome students. Ask each for their name, position, and what they want from the course. This will set the tone of what you teach. It will go faster with Data Scientists, longer if not.
2. Explain the modular nature of the course.
3. Explain that the students will get the course materials in the form of a PDF and the example code and data files.  
4. Explain that you want feedback as you go, not just at the end. At the end of each Module, the students will be asked if they can meet the objectives set out at the start. 

Slide 2: Introduction
1. Explain the logistics of the course and module as described on the slide.

Slide 3: Module 1 Learning Objectives
1. Explain the lesson and module learning objectives as shown on the slide.
2. Tell the students to write down notes as they go - each step will build on the next, each module on the next. They will use their own notes to learn their own path.
